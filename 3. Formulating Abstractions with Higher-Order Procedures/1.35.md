The *golden ratio*:

$$\phi^2 = \phi + 1 $$

Let the transformation of $x$ be:

$$ x \mapsto 1 + 1/x $$

By putting the transformation in the equivalence form:

$$ x = 1 + 1/x $$

By multiplying by $x$ for both sides:

$$ x^2 = x + 1 $$

Which is equivalent to the *golden ratio*, thus $ x = \phi $.
