```scm
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

### a.

```scm
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
```

The procedure `p` is applied 5 times.

### b.

The procedure `p` is applied once for each complete power of 3 contained within the angle, thus the space and number of steps is logarithmic. We have O(log a) growth.
