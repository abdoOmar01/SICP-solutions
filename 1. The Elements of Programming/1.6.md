### Trace

```scm
(sqrt 2)
(sqrt-iter 1.0 2)
(new-if (good-enough? 1.0 2) 1.0 (sqrt-iter (improve 1.0 2) 2))
(new-if #f 1.0 (sqrt-iter 1.5 2))
(new-if #f 1.0 (new-if (good-enough? 1.5 2) 1.5 (sqrt-iter (improve 1.5 2) 2)))
(new-if #f 1.0 (new-if #f 1.5 (sqrt-iter 1.4167 2)))
(new-if #f 1.0 (new-if #f 1.5 (new-if (good-enough? 1.4167 2) 1.4167 (sqrt-iter (improve 1.4167 2) 2))))
```

The program keeps running indefinitely, as the new procedure `new-if` doesn't follow the same rules of evaluation as the *special form* `if`.
