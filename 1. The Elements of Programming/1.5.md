```scm
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))

(test 0 (p))
```

### Normal-order Evaluation

```scm
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if #t 0 (p))
0
```

Normal-order evaluation evaluates each subexpression until only primitive expressions remain, which is why, as soon as the interpreter evaluates the condition, it returns 0.

### Applicative-order Evaluation

```scm
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
```

Applicative-order evaluation evaluates operand expressions, and then applies the operator on the operands, that's why it keeps getting stuck re-evaluating the expression `p`.
