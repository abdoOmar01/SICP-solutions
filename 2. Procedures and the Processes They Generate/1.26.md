```scm
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp) (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                                   (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                                m))
        (else (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m))))
```

By writing the `even?` case using explicit multiplication, this results in a tree-recursive process, which means that computing the exponent of a number will take a number of multiplications equal to `exp`.
